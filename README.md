# Design

## Colour Scheme

<img src="assets/images/colour-scheme-screenshot.png">
<li>The colour scheme was kept very simple with basic grey tones as background, footer and buttons and the addition of two simple contrasting colours with light green for the user and light red for the computer to give the two boxes clear separation.
</li>

<br>

## Typography

<li>Font was chosen and imported from Google Fonts.
All text contains font: Nunito.
It was chosen for its simplicity and playfulness.
The decision to use only one font was based on the very limited amount of text content.
All font is displayed in a basic black colour.</li>
<br>

# Testing

<li>Manual testing of buttons to generate game play.</li>
<li>Manual testing to ensure text appears as result message.</li>
<li>Manual testing to ensure correct text result message appears.</li>

<li>Manual testing of code indentation and correct code formats.</li>
<li>Manual testing to verify class and id names are used accurately.</li>

## Validator testing

<img src="assets/images/html-validation.png">
<br>

#### CSS
<li>One inital error was found on first testing. This was simply a mistake of adding ## twice before a hed colour code. The site still worked and this was not picked up until the CSS validation site. It was a simple mistake to correct and on the second attempt no errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.</li>

<br>

#### JavaScript
<li>19 errors were found on first testing however 7 of those were simple overuse of semi-colons and were quickly corrected. 12 errors remain as seen in below screenshot from the official (JSHint) validator. 
</li>
<li>Note row 18 error was tested in multiple ways and decided to keep code as is because all attempts at alterations created a bug in the gamePlay function. The game functions as planned regardless of this warning.</li>
<li>Note all other warning except row 18 are similar "available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)." Upon searching on forums for a solution to this error I only came across suggestions to change the settings on VS Code in order to prevent this error message. However instructions found on multiple forums to change JSHint settings on VS Code was not possible as it did not come up in settings search on Gitpod. Due to the fact that the game functions as planned I decided to ignore these warnings.</li>
